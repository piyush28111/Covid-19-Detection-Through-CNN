# Infected-lungs-vs-Healthy-lungs-classification-via-CNN

As a first step of data extraction and pre processing can be found in Data preprocessing.ipynb.

After getting all the data I have divided myself the images in training and validation images in mounted drive. I have used the CNN layers with dense layers to make a model and used data augmentation for training images.

The model worked really well on both training and validation dataset. Due to less availability of test images I used 6 images out of which 5 were correclty classified.
